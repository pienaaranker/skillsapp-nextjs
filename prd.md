Modulern: Architecture and Plan
1. Problem Statement
Learning a new skill online without enrolling in paid courses often involves sifting through vast amounts of unorganized, free content. Finding a structured, high-quality learning path tailored to an individual's experience level is challenging and time-consuming.
2. Proposed Solution
Develop a web application that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically Gemini, to:
Search and identify relevant, high-quality free learning resources across the web for any given skill.
Generate personalized learning curricula based on the user's chosen skill and stated experience level (beginner, intermediate, advanced).
Break down the curriculum into easy-to-follow steps.
Suggest practice exercises and generate custom assignments based on the current learning module.
Provide a progress tracking system for users to monitor their learning journey.
3. Technology Stack
Frontend: Next.js (React framework for building user interfaces, server-side rendering capabilities)
Backend: Next.js API Routes (for handling API requests, interacting with the database and LLM)
Database: Firebase Firestore (NoSQL cloud database)
Authentication: Firebase Authentication
Storage: Firebase Storage (Optional, for user submissions)
LLM: Google Gemini (for web searching, curriculum generation, assignment creation)
Hosting: Vercel (serverless deployment platform optimized for Next.js)

Frontend (Next.js): Handles user interface, user input (skill selection, experience level), displaying the curriculum, learning steps, assignments, and progress. Manages user authentication state via Firebase Auth.
Backend (Next.js API Routes): Acts as the intermediary between the frontend, database, and LLM. Handles API calls, fetching/saving user progress to Firestore, sending requests to the Gemini API via the proxy server (`https://proxy-chi-plum.vercel.app/`), and processing responses before sending them to the frontend. Uses Firebase Admin SDK for backend operations.
Firebase (Firestore, Auth, Storage): Firestore stores user data (profiles, skills being learned, progress, saved curricula, completed assignments). Firebase Auth handles user authentication securely. Firebase Storage can optionally store user-submitted files.
Google Gemini API: Receives requests from the backend (via the proxy) to perform web searches for learning materials, generate structured curricula, and create custom assignments.
Web Search / Data Sources: Represents the external websites, documentation, tutorials, videos, etc., that Gemini will search to find relevant free content.
5. Role of the LLM (Gemini)
Gemini will be the core intelligence of the application. Its primary functions will include:
Resource Discovery: Using its web-searching capabilities to find free online articles, tutorials, videos, and other resources related to the user's chosen skill and experience level.
Curriculum Generation: Analyzing the discovered resources and structuring them into a logical, step-by-step learning path. This involves identifying foundational concepts, progressive topics, and relevant practice materials. The curriculum should be tailored to the user's specified experience level.
Content Summarization/Extraction: Potentially summarizing key information from resources or extracting specific instructions for learning steps.
Assignment Creation: Generating unique practice problems or projects based on the concepts covered in a specific module or step of the curriculum. These assignments should help the user apply their newly acquired knowledge.
Prompt Engineering Considerations:
Crafting effective prompts for Gemini will be crucial. Prompts will need to be carefully designed to:
Clearly specify the desired skill and user's experience level.
Instruct Gemini to find free resources.
Request the output in a structured format (e.g., JSON) that the backend can easily parse into a curriculum structure.
Specify the desired format and type of assignments.
6. Key Features and Implementation Notes
User Authentication: Implement secure user registration and login using Firebase Authentication (consider using `firebaseui-web` for pre-built components or build custom flows).
Skill Selection and Experience Level: Create a user interface for users to input the skill they want to learn. Provide options to select a predefined experience level ("beginner", "intermediate", "expert") or choose a "custom" option. The custom option will trigger a quiz designed to gauge the user's current knowledge and skills, and this assessment will be used as context for generating the personalized curriculum.
Curriculum Generation Flow:
User requests a curriculum for a skill.
Frontend sends a request to the backend API, including the selected skill and either the predefined experience level or the results from the custom quiz.
Backend calls the Gemini API (through the proxy at `https://proxy-chi-plum.vercel.app/`) with a carefully crafted prompt including the skill and experience level (or quiz results for custom).
Gemini searches the web and generates a structured curriculum (e.g., an array of modules, each with steps and resource links).
Backend receives the curriculum data, saves it to Firestore, associating it with the user, and sends it to the frontend.
Frontend displays the curriculum to the user.
Step-by-Step Learning: Display the curriculum steps clearly. Allow users to mark steps as complete.
Progress Tracking: Store user progress (which skills they are learning, which steps are completed) in Firestore. Display progress visually on the frontend (e.g., progress bars).
Assignment Generation:
When a user is ready for an assignment for a specific module/step, the frontend requests one from the backend.
Backend calls the Gemini API (through the proxy at `https://proxy-chi-plum.vercel.app/`) with a prompt requesting an assignment based on the completed learning material.
Gemini generates a unique assignment.
Backend saves the assignment to Firestore and sends it to the frontend for display.
Consider allowing users to submit their completed assignments (optional, could be text input or file upload using Firebase Storage) and potentially use Gemini to provide feedback (more advanced).
Resource Linking: Ensure the links provided in the curriculum point directly to the free learning materials found by Gemini.
User Dashboard: A personalized dashboard showing the skills the user is currently learning, their overall progress, and suggested next steps.
7. Potential Challenges and Considerations
LLM Hallucinations: Gemini might occasionally generate inaccurate information or links. Implement checks where possible and allow users to report issues.
Finding Truly Free Resources: Ensuring Gemini consistently finds genuinely free and accessible content might require careful prompt tuning and potentially filtering results.
Curriculum Quality: The quality of the generated curriculum will depend heavily on the prompt engineering and the data Gemini has access to. Iteration and user feedback will be crucial.
Parsing LLM Output: Reliably parsing the structured output from Gemini (e.g., JSON) in the backend is essential.
Scalability: As the user base grows, consider the cost and performance implications of frequent calls to the Gemini API and Firestore usage (read/write limits).
User Experience: Design a clean and intuitive user interface that makes it easy for users to navigate the curriculum and track progress.
Quiz Design: Designing effective quizzes to accurately gauge a user's experience level for a wide range of skills will be challenging and require careful consideration.
8. Next Steps
Set up your development environment: Install Node.js, Next.js.
Initialize your Next.js project.
Set up Firebase: Create a Firebase project, enable Firestore, Authentication, and optionally Storage. Configure security rules.
Integrate Firebase with Next.js: Use the Firebase JavaScript SDK in your Next.js application (client-side) and the Firebase Admin SDK (server-side/API routes).
Obtain Google Gemini API access: Get API keys and understand the API documentation.
Implement User Authentication: Set up user registration and login using Firebase Auth in your Next.js app.
Develop the core curriculum generation API route: Create a backend API route in Next.js that takes skill and experience level as input (including handling custom quiz results), calls the Gemini API, and returns the curriculum data. Focus on prompt engineering here.
Build the frontend UI for skill selection and curriculum display, including the custom quiz flow.
Implement progress tracking: Add functionality to mark steps complete and store progress in Firestore. Display progress on the frontend.
Develop the assignment generation API route and UI.
Iterate and refine: Continuously test the curriculum and assignment generation, refine prompts, and improve the user interface based on feedback.
This outline provides a starting point. Building a full application like this will be an iterative process, but your chosen tech stack is well-suited for the task. Good luck!
